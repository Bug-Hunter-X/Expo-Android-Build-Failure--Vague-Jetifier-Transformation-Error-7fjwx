The core problem is identifying the conflicting dependency.  Here's a breakdown of how to solve this:

1. **Examine `package.json`:** Carefully review your project's dependencies. Look for libraries that are outdated or known for causing issues with Android builds.  Consider libraries with a history of reported Android compatibility problems.

2. **Update Dependencies:** Begin by updating all your packages using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`. This often resolves minor version conflicts.

3. **Systematic Removal:** If updating doesn't work, you'll need a more systematic approach. Comment out sections of your `package.json` dependencies one by one, rebuilding the app after each change. This allows you to isolate the problematic dependency.

4. **Use a Dependency Analyzer:** Tools like `npm-check` or similar can help identify outdated or problematic dependencies.

5. **Replace conflicting libraries (if found):** If you've isolated a particular library causing the conflict, search for suitable replacements with better Android compatibility.

6. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes, ensure you clean your project's build cache before attempting another build.  In Expo, this might involve deleting the `node_modules` folder and re-installing dependencies, and potentially cleaning the Android build directory. 

**Example (Illustrative):**
Let's assume library `react-native-old-library` is causing the issue.  The solution might involve replacing it with a newer, better-maintained alternative or a completely different solution.

```javascript
//In your package.json:
// "react-native-old-library": "1.0.0"  (conflicting dependency)

// Update or replace with a more compatible library
// "react-native-updated-library": "^2.0.0"
```
