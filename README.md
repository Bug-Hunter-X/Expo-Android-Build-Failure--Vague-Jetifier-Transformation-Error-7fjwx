# Expo Android Build Failure: Vague Jetifier Transformation Error

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose issue when building Android apps with Expo CLI. The problem stems from the `jetifier` transformation process failing without providing a clear indication of the problematic dependency.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to build the Android app using `expo build:android`. 

You will encounter a vague error related to `jetifier` failing to transform libraries. The exact error message may vary.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining your `package.json` file and identifying dependencies that might be causing conflicts. This usually involves older libraries or libraries known for incompatibility issues.  A systematic approach of removing or updating dependencies might be necessary.
